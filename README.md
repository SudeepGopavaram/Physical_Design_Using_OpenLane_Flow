# Physical_Design_Using_OpenLane_Flow
This repository contains a detailed description of a RTL2GDSII flow using a opensource OpenLane flow, design used for this run is PicoRV32 which is a CPU core that implements the RISC-V Instruction Set.

#OpenLane
It is an automated RTL2GDSII flow which make use of several other opensource tools throughout the run to generate the GDSII like, OpenROAD, Yosys, Magic, Netgen, CVC, SPEF-Extractor, KLayout and other custom script for optimized flow.

RTL2GDSII flow consist of various steps involved which help in converting Register Transfer Level(RTL) to a fabrication ready GDSII(Graphic Design System) format it is a industry standard for data exchange of IC layout.
